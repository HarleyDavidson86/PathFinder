<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For some time now, I have been pursuing the goal of programming an adventure game.
An important part of such a game consists of clicking on a location on the scene 
whereupon the player moves along a path that is as short or as sensible as possible
to the destination.
This library is intended to provide this functionality.
